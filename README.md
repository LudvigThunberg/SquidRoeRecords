Conclusion.

My the coding part of my project went according to plan, i did what i had planned. My biggest issue with this project was the deployment 
of the backend/cms. I wanted to do a deployment, but my biggest issue was that i did'nt want to pay to much per month. One of the problems was that i 
did'nt have control of the code of my backend code because i used a CMS. Even if it was easy to use Strapi, it was really hard to deploy it. 
It took me several days, and multiple versions of the CMS just to get that going. In hindsight i probably just should have used the next API 
and a database like firebase, and i'm doing that now. I'm currently re-writing the whole backendpart of the project in a forked version of this project here https://github.com/LudvigThunberg/SquidRoe2. The idea is to build a stable backend solution with polymorphism if i want to change database in the future, if you want to check it out you can check the branch feat/admin-page.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
